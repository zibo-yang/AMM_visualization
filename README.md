##Introduction of AMM
An automated market maker (AMM) is a type of decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol that relies on a mathematical formula to price assets.
//picture

Most of AMM uses x * y = k, where x is the amount of one token in the liquidity pool, and y is the amount of the other. In this formula, k is a fixed constant, meaning the poolâ€™s total liquidity always has to remain the same.

What authur programmed here is the complex version of AMM with formula changed to:
$$x*y + z(x + y) = k$$
